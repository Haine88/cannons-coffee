                <p>What is coffee â€¦ other than the beverage of choice for people with excellent taste, that is.
                    An even more accurate question might be what is coffee made of? Coffee beans, sure but did you know
                    those are actually
                    seeds found inside the cherries (also called the fruit) of coffee trees? They grow in more than 40
                    countries around the
                    world, and when dried, roasted, and ground, the seeds are used tobrew coffee.</p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Wild coffee plants, probably from Kefa (Kaffa), Ethiopia, were taken to southern Arabia and placed
                    under cultivation
                    in the 15th century. One of many legends about the discovery of coffee is that of Kaldi, an Arab
                    goatherd who was
                    puzzled
                    by the strange antics of his flock. About 850 ce Kaldi supposedly sampled the berries of the
                    evergreen bush on which
                    the
                    goats were feeding and, on experiencing a sense of exhilaration, proclaimed his discovery to the
                    world.</p>
